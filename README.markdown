GeoFence
==================================================

**GeoFence** is a java web application that provides an advanced authentication/authorization engine for [GeoServer](http://www.geoserver.org) using the interface 
described in [GSIP 57](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GSIP+57+-+Improving+GeoServer+authorization+framework).

**GeoFence** can be run either as a standalone application, or embedded into GeoServer.

The **GeoFence** *standalone application* provides a graphical user interface to administer GeoServer users and authorization rules. Furthermore, a quite complete [REST API](https://github.com/geoserver/geofence/wiki/REST-API) allows the programmatic administration of the rules and their ancillary data.  
In this configuration GeoServer needs a module (the **probe**) that will send authorization queries to GeoFence using a configurable internal protocol (by default it uses Spring remoting over HTTP).

The *embedded* configuration will make the GeoFence engine run within GeoServer itself. The administration GUI will be seamlessly embedded into GeoServer itself.


License
==================================================
**GeoFence** core modules and GUI, as well as the part of **GeoFence** that shall be installed as a module into GeoServer (either the **probe** or the **embedded** logic), are free and Open Source software, released under the [GPL v2] license,  (which is [GPL v2.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html)), as it implements a GeoServer Java API.

Getting GeoFence
==================================================

Since there are two different ways to run **GeoFence**, you'll need different set of files according to your configuration.

<dl>
  <dt>Standalone</dt>
  <dd>You'll need the <em>GeoFence</em> .war file, and the probe module to be deployed into GeoServer.</dd>

  <dt>Embedded</dt>
  <dd>You'll only need to deploy the linked embedded module into GeoServer. The embedded version is only available starting from the 3.0 version.</dd>
</dl>


Since GeoFence and GeoServer run side to side, every change of the API in either side requires a change on the other one.
Here's a compatibility table for the versions of both applications:
